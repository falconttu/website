        Analog Deity is a mobile where you spot the difference between two
        images and finding the image that is possesed by a <b>deity.</b> If you
        choose right, you are rewarded with coins which you can later spend on
        powerups such as the <i>magnifying glass</i>. However, if you choose
        wrong, one of your <i>lives</i> gets taken away and you're made to
        choose again. If you loose all yuor lives, you're made to go to the shop
        and buy more lives with the <i>coins</i> you've earned by playing the
        game, or you can watch an video ad and get 1 extra life. You can also
        buy coins via microtransactions.
