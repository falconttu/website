      Analog Deity is a mobile where you spot the difference between two images
      and finding the image that is possesed by a <b>deity.</b> If you choose
      right, you are rewarded with coins which you can later spend on powerups
      such as the <i>magnifying glass</i>. However, if you choose wrong, one of
      your <i>lives</i> gets taken away and you're made to choose again. If you
      loose all yuor lives, you're made to go to the shop and buy more lives
      with the <i>coins</i> you've earned by playing the game, or you can watch
      an video ad and get 1 extra life. You can also buy coins via
      microtransactions.
