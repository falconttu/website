# My Personal Website
This repository contains the code and and all resources required to run my **personal website**. The repository is also used for version control and to be accessable anywhere with an internet connection.

As of right now, the wesite is still under-constuction and is to not be shared with anyone, but the following points listed down below will be available on **V1**:

- A homepage which features links to webpages for certain sections related to me and my works
	> Design language for the website is still undecided, hence a concrete description cannot be given.

- A webpage to showcase all of my projects
- A webpage to showcase my renders
