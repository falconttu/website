              Final entry. One of my teammates made the music and started on the
              documentation process whilst another teammate helped me import all
              the 3D models into Unity. I have been getting everyone to tell me
              if they have any feedback on anything that needs to be polished.
              Regardless, I took it upon myself to add the finishing touches to
              the game.

              Happy new year's! Whilst one of my teammates is working on getting
              the magnifying glass working, another teammate and I have been
              working on the 3D scenes we plan on having in the game,
              specifically in the main menu and the actual game scene.

              We have gotten more images into the game and have also gotten to
              randomize each time the player plays the game. We have now decided
              that with this we can get our powerup, the magnifying glass can
              start to be worked on.

              One of my teammates pointed out that we needed to be working at a
              faster pace, on which I can agree. We decided that the XP
              progression system needs to be fast tracked to finish all the core
              mechanics of the game.

              Not a lot of work was done over the last week, as other projects
              had to be finished. I spent the entire day working on meeting a
              deadline for another project.

              My supervisor wanted us to fill out a form to get our game on the
              Play Store, so I started the process but had many questions and
              just plain doubts overall. Luckily, my teammate came to the rescue
              and did the rest.

              No real progress was made during this week as I was working on
              other projects. However, I did have a talk with my team to
              delegate tasks and to get the Trello board set-up.

              The whole class presented their pitch on the Monday. I thought our
              teams pitch went quite well as our supervisor and assessor seemed
              quite interested in our idea, if not sightly intrigued. We got
              some feedback from the presentation which I hope to go through
              with my teammates.

              This week, A teammate and I got together to build a prototype to
              showcase a proof of concept for the pitch that's due in the next
              session. We first tried to get the unity project up on a GitHub
              repository, but GitHub being the ever-confusing platform it is,
              made it so that LFS had to be set-up to even get the project
              uploaded. After passing through that hurdle, my teammate got a
              barebones proof of concept built. Later during the week, the whole
              team got together to make the presentation slides.
